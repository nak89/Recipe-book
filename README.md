# 📖 Recipe Book — Frontend

A personal cookbook web application built with React and TypeScript. Users can create accounts, manage their own recipe collections, and cook through step-by-step guides.

## Features

- **Authentication** — Signup, login, and logout with JWT-based sessions
- **Recipe management** — Full CRUD: add, edit, copy, and remove recipes
- **Rich recipe data** — Ingredients with quantities and units, step-by-step cooking instructions, tools and utensils, duration, servings
- **Extended fields** — Cuisine, course type (Starter / Main / Dessert), difficulty level, nutritional values (calories, protein, carbs, fat)
- **Photo upload** — Upload recipe photos directly from your device (powered by Cloudinary)
- **Favourites** — Toggle recipes as favourites with a single click
- **Search and filtering** — Filter by title, difficulty, cuisine, course, and duration simultaneously
- **Cooking wizard** — Dedicated prep screen (ingredients + tools) and steps screen with a guided flow
- **Duplicate detection** — Prevents saving identical recipes or duplicate titles
- **Remove confirmation** — Modal confirmation before deleting a recipe
- **Copy to prefill** — Duplicate a recipe into the form pre-filled for easy variations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- The [Recipe Book Backend](link-to-backend-repo) running locally

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:yourusername/recipe-book.git
   cd recipe-book
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure the API URL in `src/config.ts`:

   ```typescript
   export const API_URL = "http://localhost:3000";
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

> Make sure your backend server is also running on port 3000 before starting the frontend.

## Key Concepts Used

- **React Context API** for global auth state (`useAuth` hook)
- **Protected routes** redirect unauthenticated users to `/login`
- **JWT token** stored in `localStorage`, attached to every API request via `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
- **Debounced search** — search input waits 300ms after typing before filtering
- **`useMemo`** for performant frontend filtering
- **`React.memo`** on `RecipeCard` to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Optimistic UI** — favourite toggle and remove update state only after backend confirms success
- **Form/API type separation** — `FormIngredient`/`FormStep` types used during editing, converted to `Ingredient`/`Step` on save
- **Cloudinary** photo upload via the backend (keeps API credentials server-side)

## Scripts

```bash
npm run dev        # Start development server
npm run build      # Build for production
npm run preview    # Preview production build locally
```
